2,"adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status",39
2,It was generally agreed that consistency with international human rights law would require that interpretation by the Court be consistent with the principle of nullum crimen sine lege. A view was also expressed that this should be explicitly stated in this article or be made clearer in article 21.,41
2,"Crimes against humanity might usefully be viewed as an implementation of human rights norms within international criminal law. Just as human rights law addresses atrocities and other violations perpetrated by the State against its own population, crimes against humanity are focused on prosecuting the individuals who commit such violations",46

2,"for the purposes of this Convention, torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions",85
2,"the word torture is often used to describe inhuman treatment, which has a purpose, such as the obtaining of information or confessions, or the infliction of punishment, and is generally an aggravated form of inhuman treatment",87
2,"the five techniques [interrogation techniques used by British security forces against suspect terrorists [...] as applied in combination, undoubtedly amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment, although their object was the extraction of confessions, the naming of others and/or information and although they were used systematically, they did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture as so understood",88
2,"each State Party shall ensure that all acts of torture are offences under its criminal law. Furthermore, State Parties are obliged to make torture, as well as the attempt to commit torture and the complicity in torture, punishable by appropriate penalties",102
2,"for the purposes of this Convention, torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity",108

2,"coercing the victim or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimina-tion of any kind,",182
2,"[t]he Chamber considers that rape is a form of aggression and that the central elements of the crime of rape cannot be captured in a mechanical description of objects and body parts. The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment does not catalogue specific acts in its definition of torture, focusing rather on the conceptual frame work of  state  sanctioned  violence.  This  approach  is  more  useful  in  international law. Like torture, rape is used for such purposes as intimidation, degradation, humiliation,  discrimination,  punishment,  control  or  destruction  of  a  person. Like torture, rape is a violation of personal dignity, and rape in fact consti-tutes torture when inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capaci-ty.",185
2,"[e]ach State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to en-sure  to  all  individuals  within  its  territory  and  subject  to  its  jurisdiction  the rights  recognized  in  the  present  Covenant,  without  distinction  of  any  kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, nation-al or social origin, property, birth or other status.",199
2,"in time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the ex-istence  of  which  is  officially  proclaimed,  the  States  Parties  to  the  present Covenant  may  take  measures  derogating  from  their  obligations  under  the present Covenant to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situa-tion, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with their other obliga-tions under international law and do not involve discrimination solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin.",200
2,"any distinction, exclusion of restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the politi-cal, economic, social cultural, civil or any other field.",206

2,"Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a)  Physical,  sexual  and  psychological  violence  occurring  in  the  family,  in-cluding battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related violence, marital rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to ex-ploitation; (b) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution; (c) Physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, wherever it occurs.",211
