1,Box 1: Some definitions used by different organisations and scholars,8
2,"UNDP: Access to Justice is the ability of people to seek and obtain a remedy through formal or informal institutions of justice, and in conformity with human rights standards",8
2,"World Bank: Justice for the Poor is an attempt by the World Bank to grapple with some of the theoretical and practical challenges of promoting justice sector reform in a number of countries in Africa and East Asia. Justice for the Poor reflects an understanding of the need for demand oriented, community driven approach to justice and governance reform, which values the perspectives of the users, particularly the poor and marginalized as women, youth, and ethnic minorities",8
2,"Stephen Golub (based on experience within the Asian Development Bank and the Ford Foundation): Legal empowerment is the use of legal services, often in combination with related development activities, to increase disadvantaged populations' control over their lives. It is both an alternative to the problematic, state-centric rule-of-law orthodoxy and a means for making rights-based development a reality using law to support broader socio-economic development initiatives",8
1,ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND LEGAL EMPOWERMENT,8
2,The Commission for Legal Empowerment of the Poor (CLEP) is dedicated to the fight against poverty by identifying and providing the poor with legal and institutional tools that allow them to benefit from greater security and to create wealth within the rule of law,8
2,CLEP's work is based on the view that poor women and men generally lack effective legal protection and recognition for their economic assets and transactions,8
2,"John W. Bruce et al. in a report for USAID: Legal empowerment of the poor occurs when the poor, their supporters, or governments employing legal and other means create rights, capacities, and/or opportunities for the poor that give them new power to use law and legal tools to escape poverty and marginalization. Empowerment is a process, an end in itself, and a means of escaping poverty",9
1,Why are Access to Justice and Legal Empowerment Important?,10
2,"Research on the functioning of law and legal systems in developing countries has found that legal reforms, even when they aim to benefit the poor, do not always produce the expected results as asymmetric power relations work to their disadvantage.",10

2,Box 2a: Obstacles to Justice and Empowerment through the Legal System,11
3,"Supply side: Also referred to as justice providers or duty bearers. Includes village elders, chiefs, local village authorities, regional authorities, national legislative and administrative bodies, police, prosecution services and court systems.",11
3,"Legislation and other norms in the formal and informal legal systems: anti-poor and gender bias, excessive number of laws, norms expressed in alien, foreign or formalistic language",11
3,"Courts or other adjudicative and enforcement institutions (state and non-state): anti-poor and gender bias, lack of judicial independence and impartiality, lack of transparency, slowness, costs, lack of adequate information regarding legal norms and legal practice",11

3,"(Economic) dependency prevents the poor and weak from enforcing their rights against employers, husbands or landlords",12
3,Negative perceptions of legal institutions and litigation and social stigma incurred from turning to the law to seek justice,12
3,Distrust of legal institutions and the law. Such distrust often coincides with perceptions that getting justice from the legal system is difficult or impossible,12
3,"Conditions of illegality regarding housing, payment of taxes or registration lead to fear of formal courts",12
2,Box 2b: Obstacles to Justice and Empowerment through the Legal System,12
3,widespread corruption and abuse of power,12

2,Legal empowerment and access to justice are sensitive areas with political limitations,16
2,Reforms need to address both state and non-state justice systems,17
3,Comprehensive conceptual frameworks on access to justice and legal empowerment need to focus explicitly on both the prevention of grievances and the obtaining of remedies against them.,17
2,"Research in Indonesia and Ghana has shown that although in most cases people prefer to settle their disputes and claim their rights through non-state and conciliatory means, at times, they prefer to take their cases to a state court to obtain an authoritative or more just decision.",18

2,Box 5: Access to Justice Does Not Always Provide the Solution: the Issue of Child Maintenance in Ghana,24
3,"Non-maintenance of children by their fathers is a pressing social problem in Ghana. As a result of access to justice reforms, Ghanaian mothers can now use various channels to pursue their claims. Many women have sought and obtained assistance to claim child maintenance, either through ADR or through court proceedings. In many instances, their claims have been found legitimate. This, however, did not always lead to fathers paying child maintenance. For various reasons, enforcement has been seriously hampered. Thus, although these mothers have (reasonable) access to justice, actual justice is not done.",24

2,"How law can aid development has been the focus of much recent discussion among development workers, scholars and policy makers. Indeed, reforms to improve poor people’s access to justice and to promote their legal empower- ment comprise the latest trend in legal development co-operation.",33
2,"Furthermore, it outlines important considerations for policy makers when programming access to justice and legal empowerment reforms. One of the lessons learned is that access to justice and legal empowerment are not tech- nical exercises, but touch upon sensitive areas with political limitations.",33
