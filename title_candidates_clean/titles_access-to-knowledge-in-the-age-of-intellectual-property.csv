3,the adoption of the revised drug strategy,130
3,the concept of essential medicines,131
3,"In  the  1970s,  in  public-health  circles,  there  was  a  strong  move  toward  establishing",131
3,primary  health  care.  The  selection  and  provision  of  essential  medicines  was  then,131
3,increasingly seen as a core function of governments in the context of primary care.,131
3,"As  a  result,  in  1975,  the  World  Health  Assembly,  the  annual  assembly  of  the  WHO",131
3,"member  states,  adopted  a  resolution  calling  on  the  WHO  to  assist  its  members  to",131
3,select and procure essential drugs and assure that these drugs were of good quality,131
3,and reasonable cost.,131
3,"The first WHO Essential Drugs List, containing 207 items, was",131
3,published in 1977. The purpose of the list was to identify those medicines “of utmost,131
3,"importance, basic, indispensable and necessary for the health and needs of the popu-",131
3,lation.”,131
3,"Selection criteria included issues related to efficacy, quality, safety, and cost.",131
3,"Since then, fifteen editions of the list have been published. Today, the WHO Essen-",131
3,tial  Drugs  List—rebaptized  the  Essential  Medicines  List  in  2002—contains  around,131
3,"325  items. The  list  is  regularly  updated  to  be  able  to  respond  to  new  needs,  drug",131
3,"resistance, medical advances, scientific developments, and new evidence with regard",131
3,to efficacy and safety. The Essential Medicines List is also useful to identify gaps in,131
3,"research and development of new essential medicines. For example, a few years ago,",131
3,expert discussions over the Essential Medicines List highlighted the obvious need for,131
3,pediatric formulations of AIDS medicines to treat children. Because pediatric AIDS is,131
3,"rare in rich countries, companies lacked the commercial incentive to develop easy-to-",131
3,use medications for children.,131
3,Although the basic notion that some drugs are essential and others are not and,131

3,"ridsen, the first director of the WHO Action Programme on Essential Drugs, described",131
3,it as a “peaceful revolution in international public health.”,131
3,"However, the adoption of",131
3,this new policy did not happen without controversy. The pharmaceutical industry saw,131
3,the concept of essential medicines and WHO’s work with governments on medicine,131
3,policies as a frontal attack on its freedom to operate and feared that it would lead,131
3,to  government  interference  in  the  industry’s  marketing  practices.  Countries  would,131
3,indeed use the list to exclude drugs on the Essential Medicines List from patentabil-,131
3,"ity, as was the case in the Andean region; to remove medicines from the market; to",131
3,"essential medicines, thereby reducing dependence on Western companies.",131
3,NGOs  have  played  an  important  role  in  protecting  and  promoting  the  concept,131
3,"of essential medicines. Health Action International, a global network of health and",131
3,"pharmaceutical  groups  and  individuals,  was  a  particularly  key  player  in  the  advo-",131
3,cacy  for  essential  health  policies  at  both  the  international  and  the  national  levels.,131
3,members saw the detrimental effects of the lack of essential medicines and the avail-,132
3,ability of dangerous and ineffective drugs on a daily basis.,132
3,"In 1977, the International Federation of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Asso-",132
3,"ciation,  the  main  international  lobbying  organization  for  the  multinational  phar-",132
3,"maceutical  industry,  called  the  medical  and  economic  arguments  for  the  Essential",132
3,Medicines List “fallacious” and claimed that adopting it would “result in substandard,132
3,rather  than  improved  medical  care  and  might  well  reduce  health  standards  already,132
3,attained.”,132
3,The industry was particularly concerned that the Essential Medicines List,132
3,"would  become  a  global  concept,  applicable  beyond  the  developing  world,  and,  for",132
3,"example, be used for priority setting in the marketing approval of medicines or in the",132
3,reimbursement  decisions  of  health-insurance  companies  in  industrialized  countries.,132
3,"Such measures, they feared, would, for example, limit the industry’s ability to market",132
3,aggressively new medicines that have larger profit margins than older ones.,132
3,"In 1982, a spokesman of the U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers organization said",132
3,that “the industry feels strongly that any efforts by the World Health Organization,132
3,and  national  governments  to  implement  this  action  program  should  not  interfere,132
3,"with existing private sector operations,” thereby signaling the industry’s concern that",132
3,industrialized  countries  would  use  the  concept  of  essential  medicines  to  introduce,132
3,limited lists of prioritized medicines. The Italian drug industry put it more crudely in,132
3,response to the Italian Senate’s attempts to introduce an essential medicines list: “If,132
3,"they want to turn Italy into a Third World country, this is the way to go about it.”",132
3,"According  to  the  drug  industry  view,  the  Essential  Medicines  List  should  be  a  tool",132
3,only for the public sector in the poorest nations of the world.,132
3,This  view  has  not  changed  much  in  the  last  twenty-five  years. A  2002  Interna-,132
1,"The new definition implied that governments have an obligation to assure the availability and affordability of these products. And a high price was no longer a barrier for inclusion in the list. With this measure, the WHO anticipated that the Essential Drugs List, on which national essential drugs lists are based, could become a useful tool for selecting candidate drugs for compulsory licensing or other cost-containment measures.",137
