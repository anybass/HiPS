10,Example 1: a Muslim woman’s marriage to a non-Muslim,250
11,"The Council also recognizes and acknowledges the conditions in which new Muslim sisters in the West find themselves when their husbands choose to retain their religion. The Council affirms and repeats that it is forbidden for a Muslim female to establish marriage to a non-Muslim male. This has been an issue of consensus throughout the history of this nation. However, in the case of marriage being established prior to the female entering the fold of Islam, the Council has decided the following:",250
12,"First: If both husband and wife revert to Islam and there is no shari’ah objection to their marriage in the first place, such as blood or foster relations, which deem the very establishment of marriage unlawful, the marriage shall be deemed valid and correct.",250
13,"Second: Assuming that the marriage is properly contracted in the beginning, if the husband reverts to Islam alone, while his wife remains a Jew or a Christian, then the marriage shall maintain its validity, i.e. it will not be affected by the husband’s conversion to Islam.",250
14,"Third: If the wife reverts to Islam while her husband remains on his religion, the Council sees the following:",250
15,"1) If her reversion to Islam occurs before the consummation of marriage, then they must immediately separate.",250
16,"2) If her reversion to Islam occurs after the consummation of marriage, and the husband also embraced Islam before the expiry of her period of waiting [iddah], then the marriage is deemed valid and correct.",250
17,"3) If her reversion to Islam occurs after the consummation of marriage, and the period of waiting expires, she is allowed to wait for him to embrace Islam even if that period happens to be a lengthy one.",251
17,"Once he does so and reverts to Islam, then their marriage is deemed valid and correct [emphasis added].",251
17,"4) If the wife chooses to marry another man after the expiration of the period of waiting, she must first request a dissolution of marriage through legal channels.",251
17,"Fourth: According to the four main schools of jurisprudence, it is forbidden for the wife to remain with her husband, or indeed to allow him conjugal rights, once her period of waiting has expired.",251
17,"However, some scholars see that it is for her to remain with him, allowing him to enjoy full conjugal rights, if he does not prevent her from exercising her religion and she has hope in him to revert to Islam [emphasis added].",251
18,Example 2: interest-based mortgages,252
18,"If all the above suggestions are unavailable, the Council, in the light of evidence and juristic considerations, see no harm in buying mortgaged houses if the following restrictions are strictly observed: (a) the house to be bought must be for the buyer and his household; (b) the buyer must not have another house; (c) the buyer must not have any surplus of assets that can help him buy a house by means other than mortgage.",252
