2,"Clinic directors who are not law school academic staff members may nevertheless seek access to study leave from time to time. Typically, such leave can cost the clinic up to six months’ annual salary.",228
2,"Locum expenditures are often overlooked in clinic budgetary discussions, but they are essential for sustainable clinic operations. A supervisor who routinely returns to work after annual leave to find that their students were effectively unsupervised or poorly supervised in their absence will become dissatisfied and start to look for other employment. Since good supervisors are difficult to find in the first place, their loss for this sort of reason has many implications for clinic reputation and clients’ outcomes.",228
2,"Gai Walker (see footnote 20) has contributed several specific suggestions to the detail of office accommodation. For example, the university or other funders will have a square-metre-staff-required-space formula that may be applicable. Walker states that the Western Australian government requires 13m2 for each person employed. Further, since the law school will expect and even require a closely related clinic to apply for external funds, it ought to seek additional space above and beyond the recommended m2 allowance, to cope with the extra accommodation required if external fundraising is successful. Note that it is not realistic to cost externship accommodation using this measure because the organisations in which externships are located will share their own facilities with students, other organisations and any external (law school) supervisors.",229
2,"Gai Walker (see footnote 20) suggests also that ‘workstations need to be set up appropriately’ for occupational health purposes, ideally through the university; that ‘IT support from the University is invaluable’ and is far less expensive than through private providers. She adds ‘replacement provisions for equipment within the university programs is important. Interview rooms should be cabled so that a laptop can be taken into the room to help with internet access forms … [and] phone equipment should ALWAYS include headsets for EACH phone … with voicemail on staff phones’.",229
