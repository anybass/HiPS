1,The main doubt: a merely apparent disagreement?,112
2,"The legal order had none. So, irrespective of other applications of analogy in the legal field, this means that only analogy gauged to fill a gap is at stake here.",110
2,"By transforming the analogical approach, in a two-step sequence, into an usual process of weighting principles, namely one performed with the Alexyan ‘Weight Formula’, Brożek sees partial reduction as a scheme that simplifies the whole process of filling a gap. The analysis of factors and meta-factors is no longer needed, be it for facts, cases, or rules, and the absence of a rule for a case becomes a normative situation where only a balancing has to be carried out. In his own words, the partial reducibility thesis allows us to ‘get rid of the problematic process of deciding which similarities are relevant similarities’.",111

1,"This puts the disagreement in a very peculiar place. First, it looks like we totally agree. Second, it looks like the whole discussion has been transferred to two different issues: (i) whether the existence of similar",114
1,"rules under applicable principles prevents their application; and (ii) whether it makes sense, notwithstanding its conventional nature, to speak of a gap as a situa- tion without a specific rule for a case where there is an applicable principle. Let us analyse both.",114
1,"Regarding the first issue, the parallel between the modified ‘motorcycle case’ and the ‘case’ already gives us a consistent frame of reference to see that nothing seems to justify the premise that, under applicable prin- ciples, the existence of similar rules, i.e. rules not addressing the given case, prevents the applicability of those principles. A direct subsumption of the",114
2,"The point that no rules existed in the ‘Lebach case’ (LBVerfGE 35, 202, Constitutional Court of Germany, 1973) might not be totally accurate. Nevertheless, it is the way the case has been presented and discussed. See for instance, Alexy, 2002, p.105.",114

2,"Because, if not, one would have to admit that the scope covered by all rules of a legal order is not also covered by all principles of that legal order, which I think is false.

2,"There is no necessary connection between the two at all. Two additional notes are needed here. First, it is not totally clear what is ‘the same legal question’ or, as Brożek also puts it, the ‘same kind of problem’. Even if it is a pair of contradictory statements, like p or ¬p, nothing prevents the definition of the prevailing statement laying outside the principles invoked by",117
