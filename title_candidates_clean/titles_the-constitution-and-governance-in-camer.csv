1,Conclusion,266
2,Public participation is ubiquitous in recent constitution-making processes and it has received wide support.,266
2,That approach is advocated for a number of reasons.,266
2,"First,  it  fosters  ownership  of  the  process  and  the  outcome.",266
2,"Second,  it  lends legitimacy  to  the  document  and  the  governance  system  that  eventually  results from it.",266
2,"Third, it is seen as an educational exercise in democracy and a means of promoting the development of a democratic culture.",266
2,"Fourth, it gives a voice to those who would be governed by the constitution, to address past grievances and inequalities, to define their rights and aspirations and how they wish these rights and aspirations to be provided and protected by the government.",266
2,"Of  course,  public  participation  is  not  a  panacea.  There  is  also  the  possibility that a poorly designed process might undermine the positive dimensions of public participation and instead perpetuate regressive democratic practices.",266
2,"Recent and ongoing events in Cameroon indicate that, like the turbulent 1990s, a constitutional moment has arrived and, this time, things need to be done correctly.",266
