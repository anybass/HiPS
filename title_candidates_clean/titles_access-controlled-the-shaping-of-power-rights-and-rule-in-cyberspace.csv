2,1. Legal and Normative Environment for Information Control includes the following:,40
3,a. Compelling Internet sites to register with authorities and using noncompliance as grounds for filtering ‘‘illegal’’ content.,40
3,"b. Strict criteria pertaining to what is ‘‘acceptable’’ within the national media space, leading to the de-registration of sites that do not comply.",40
3,"c. Expanded use of defamation, slander, and ‘‘veracity’’ laws to deter bloggers and independent media from posting material critical of the government or specific government officials.",40
3,"d. Evoking national security concerns, especially at times of civic unrest, as the justification for blocking specific Internet content and services.",40
3,e. Legal regime for Internet surveillance.,40
2,"2. CNA has been used by both Azeri and Armenian hackers in an ongoing series of attacks. It is unclear whether these are the actions of individual hackers, or whether these groups receive tacit or direct support from the state. Attacks are directed against the Web sites of the opposing country, so are not a content control mechanism.",40
2,"3. The DDoS attacks were outsourced to commercial ‘‘black hat’’ hackers in Ukraine. The party ordering attacks is unknown, but suspicion falls on rogue elements inside the security services.",40
