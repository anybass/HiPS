1,"Established in Ramallah in 1979, al-Haq was the first Palestinian human rights organization",331
1,and one of  the first such organizations in the Arab world. This inside history explores how,331
1,al-Haq initiated methodologies in law and practice that were ahead of  its time and that proved,331
1,foundational for many strands of  today’s human rights work in Palestine and elsewhere. Lynn,331
1,Welchman looks at both al-Haq’s history and legacy to explore such questions as: Why would,331
1,one set up a human rights organization under military occupation? How would one go about,331
1,promoting the rule of  law in a Palestinian society deleteriously served by the law and with,331
1,every reason to distrust those charged with implementing its protections? How would one,331
1,work to educate overseas allies and activate international law in defense of  Palestinian rights?,331
1,This revelatory story speaks to the practice of  local human rights organizations and their,331
1,impact on international groups.,331
