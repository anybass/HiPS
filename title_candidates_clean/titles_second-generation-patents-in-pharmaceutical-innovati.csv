2,"In taking this view the Board is aware that the two enantiomers, far from falling merely intellectually within the definition of the structure in question, actually exist unseparated in the racemate. Generally, the latter can also be separated by converting the enantiomers into a mixture of diastereomers, e.g. using optically active substances, then resolving the mixture and recovering the enantiomers from the resulting products. These considerations are immaterial to the question of novelty, however, and will be more usefully applied to the examination as to inventive step.",120
2,The present invention embraces such optically active isomers and mixtures thereof,120
2,"These principles which refer to the disclosure content of a prior publication in the field of mechanics are applicable in the field of chemistry, provided that a chemical compound is viewed as prejudicial to novelty, when a prior publication or a document with earlier priority date conveys to the skilled person a concrete indication to the compound in question, that is that a skilled person easily reads this compound in his thoughts and because of this indication he is directly put in the position of laying his hands on the compound in question. It is not necessary to that the compound has actually already been prepared. The mere possibility of its preparation and, thus thereby being made available suffices (referring  α-Aminobenzylpenicillin,  Fluoran,  and  Herbicid  wirksames  Enantiomer).",121
2,"We are like dwarfs on the shoulders of giants, so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance, not by virtue of any sharpness on sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size.",135
2,"Long before the contested patent´s priority date, it was generally known to specialists that, in physiologically active substances (e.g. herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and growth regulators, but also pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs) with an asymmetrical carbon atom enabling them to occur in the form of a racemate or one of two enantiomers, one of the latter frequently has a quantitatively greater effect than the other or than the racemate. If – as here - the aim is therefore to develop agents with increased physiological activity from a physiologically active racemate the obvious first step - before any thought is given, say, to synthesizing structurally modified products - is to produce the two enantiomers in isolation and test whether one or the other is more active than the racemate. Such tests are routine. Under established Board case law, an enhanced effect cannot be adduced as evidence of inventive step if it emerges from obvious tests. Since, in the present case, tests with the enantiomers were obvious in view of the task at hand, discovery of the claimed effect of the D-enantiomers compared with corresponding racemates does not involve an inventive step.",152
2,I am not sorry to reach this conclusion. Daiichi’s work led to a better medicine than ofloxacin. Levofloxacin is not just twice as active as ofloxacin (which might have been expected) but is a lot more soluble and less toxic than was predictable. It can be used in higher dosages than might have been expected with corresponding medical benefit.,155
2,"In view of his general knowledge, as reflected in this excerpt from [another prior art], the skilled person, starting from the amorphous form of a pharmaceutically active compound as closest prior art, would have a clear expectation that a crystalline form thereof would provide a solution to the problem [to provide atorvastatin in a form having improved filterability and drying characteristic]. Although this might not be true of every crystalline form obtained [examples], it was nevertheless obvious to try this avenue with a reasonable expectation of success without involving any inventive ingenuity. [A]n arbitrary selection from a group of equally suitable candidates cannot be viewed as involving an inventive step.",160
2,"It is well-known in the field of pharmaceutical compounds that the same compounds may have various crystalline forms and that the pharmaceutical properties thereof, such as solubility, stability, etc., may vary. Thus, prior to designing a preparation method of a compound, it is common to first confirm the existence of polymorphism of the compound. Accordingly, an invention for a compound having a specific crystalline form, which is different from a compound disclosed in the prior art only in terms of the crystalline form, namely,",163
2,"an invention relating to a crystalline form, is recognized as having an inventive step only if the effect thereof is qualitatively different from a compound dis- closed in the prior art or is quantitatively very different, but not necessarily qualitatively different, from a compound disclosed in the prior art. Although not absolutely required to provide comparative experimental data with the prior art, the specification of the invention relating to a crystalline form must clearly describe the above effect, in order for the effect to be considered when deter- mining the inventive step of the invention. If the effect is questionable, the ap- plicant or the patentee must specifically demonstrate the effect through reliable comparative experimental data after the filing date of the application.",163

2,"The cost-effectiveness of me-too drugs, particularly in the [well established categories], is questionable. Although the me-too drug may prove more effective than the innovator drug for a certain population of patients, this marginal benefit is likely to be small.",194

2,"Creativity is impossible without a rich public domain. Nothing today, likely nothing since we tamed fire, is genuinely new: Culture, like science and tech- nology, grows by accretion, each new creator building on the works of those who came before. Overprotection stifles the very creative forces it's supposed to nurture.",246

1,"With respect, no one could contemplate that snapping a leaf from a tree would be worthy of a patent, whereas isolating genes to provide useful diagnostic tools and medicines is surely what the patent laws are intended to encourage and protect. Snapping a leaf from a tree is a physical separation, easily done by anyone. Creating a new chemical entity is the work of human transformation, requiring skill, knowledge, and effort.",251
1,"Takamine was the first to make it available for any use by removing it from the other gland-tissue in which it was found, and, while it is of course possible logically to call this a purification of the principle, it became for every practical purpose a new thing commercially and therapeutically.",253
1,"The wholesome realism of this doctrine is not always applied in favor of a patentee but is sometimes used against him. Thus, where a device is so far changed in principle from a patented article that it performs the same or a similar function in a substantially different way, but nevertheless falls within the literal words of the claim, the doctrine of equivalents may be used to restrict the claim and defeat the patentee's action for infringement.",273
1,"The term of a patent, which covers a product containing an active ingredient that has not been subject to the marketing approval process related to the first commercial marketing of the active ingredient, shall be the later of either i) 15 years after the marketing approval date or ii) 20 years after the patent filing date.",280
1,"First, patent law seeks to foster and reward invention; second, it promotes disclosure of inventions, to stimulate further innovation and to permit the public to practice the invention once the patent expires; third, the stringent requirements for patent protection seek to assure that ideas in the public domain remain there for the free use of the public.",289
