# :closed_book: HiPS: Hierarchical PDF Segmentation :closed_book:
The goal of this project is to create a prototype which is focusing on structural section parsing of PDF textbooks :book:.

PDF metadata from the Table of Contents (TOC) are used to match headings in the fulltext wiht various strategies, such as regex or making use of the structural tags in the XML file (that we converted the PDF into). 
Then, we assign a hierarchy level (1-7) to the headings. The output can be used for knowledge engineering (e.g., finding entities sharing a section and analyzing their relationship).
<ul>
  <li> ðŸ“š The code for reproducing our experiments</li>
  <li> ðŸ“š The ground truth dataset consisting of textbooks full of headings</li>
  <li> ðŸ“š An issue tracker for the dataset</li>
</ul>

Currently, we are adding all resources. Stay tuned for just a few days more!
